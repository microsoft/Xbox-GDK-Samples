#   Simple Meshlet Sample

*This sample is compatible with the Microsoft Game Development Kit
(March 2022) and Windows 10 (Version 2004) May 2020 Update*

# Description

This sample introduces the meshlet data structure and provides an
example of rendering using meshlets. It also demonstrates how to do
primitive culling inside of mesh shaders.

# Building the sample

If using Xbox Series X|S, set the active solution platform to `Gaming.Xbox.Scarlett.x64`.

If using PC with appropriate hardware and Windows 10 release, set the
active solution platform to Gaming.Desktop.x64.

This sample does not support Xbox One.

# Using the sample

Beyond camera controls there a few options that have been exposed with
which to be toyed.

A visual representation of the underlying meshlet structure can be
toggled with the click of a button -- each colored patch represents a
meshlet of maximum size 128.

Primitive culling can also be toggled at will. A 'debug' camera has been
placed in the scene which may be optionally used as the view against
which primitives are culled. This allows the user to visualize the
culled primitives. This camera's position & orientation can be
manipulated by holding down a button and manipulating the camera
controls.

# Implementation notes

**Meshlets** are exactly what they sound like -- fixed-sized primitive
chunks of a larger mesh. A maximum size is chosen for the meshlet
structure, then primitives & vertices are packed into meshlets until the
entire mesh has been processed. In this way a mesh an array of meshlets.

Note that the actual vertex data is unchanged by this process, but the
index buffer is replaced by three new buffers -- a *meshlet list*, a
*unique vertex index list*, and a *primitive list*. The elements of the
*meshlet list* are simple offsets & counts into the other two structures
-- this defines which vertices & primitives are in each meshlet. The
*unique vertex index list* contains chunks of de-duplicated vertex
indices for each meshlet -- these are used to directly index into the
vertex buffer. The *primitive list* defines chunks of primitives for
each meshlet. The items of this list are indices into the unique vertex
index list. Each primitive index is local to the meshlet's unique vertex
index sub-range which reduces its range to only 8-bits.

This structure maps very well to the fixed-sized threadgroups of mesh
shaders -- each meshlet can be mapped to a single threadgroup. Each
meshlet has a fixed maximum size, so this correlates nicely with the
work for which each thread will be responsible. This is the basis of the
shader BasicMeshletMS.hlsl, and is very straightforward
implementation-wise.

**Primitive culling** is the process of determining viewport relevance
per-primitive against several culling tests. Since mesh shaders
dynamically specify their output counts, discarding primitives is done
by simply omitting them from submission. The basic workflow for mesh
shader based primitive culling is the following steps:

1.  Transform meshlet vertices into cull space (generally view,
    homogeneous, or NDC.)

2.  Build primitive from transformed vertices & do cull tests

3.  Mark surviving primitives mark surviving vertices

4.  Determine final output indices of vertices & primitives via
    **compaction**

5.  Remap primitive indices to remapped vertex indices

6.  Export as usual

**Compaction** is an algorithm that produces a sparse list which indexes
into a dense list which contains both relevant & irrelevant work items
(culled & unculled.) This list takes the form of a list of indices to
use as a lookup table. In a threadgroup context this allows the
lowest-ID threads to directly access all relevant work items. This
process is somewhat complicated by the necessity of inter-wave
communication, which is handled by using groupshared memory and group
synchronization points.

# Known Issues

Disabling optimizations (`-Od`) causes `CullMeshletMS.hlsl` to be broken on
PC. This is due to a bug in the shader compiler (dxc.exe) in the version
that ships with the Windows SDK (10.0.19041.) This issue has since been
fixed in the latest release available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler).
