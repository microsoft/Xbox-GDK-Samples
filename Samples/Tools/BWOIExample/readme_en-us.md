# Build W/O Installing (BWOI) Example

*This sample is compatible with the Microsoft Game Development Kit (March 2022)*

# Description

Individual developers are expected to have both the compiler toolset &
required SDKs installed on their machines for day-to-day work. The
*Microsoft Game Development Kit* (GDK) provides Visual Studio
integration for debugging, MSBuild platforms definitions, and profiling
tools in addition to headers & libraries. Maintaining a build server,
however, is greatly simplified if you can use a 'xcopy-style' deployment
for the headers & libraries when doing daily builds. This example
demonstrates a method for building MSBuild-based projects using the
**Gaming.\*.x64** platforms without having the Microsoft GDK installed.
It also provides an option to use Windows containers to create an
isolated build environment, with no need to install Visual Studio
directly on the host machine.

# Software Setup

Build machines typically have the Visual Studio toolset and Windows SDKs
installed on them as part of a regularly maintained image. This is true
of Azure DevOps
"[Microsoft-Hosted](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops)"
and is typical of setting up a [self-hosted Windows
agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-windows?view=azure-devops)
or other custom build machine.

For building Microsoft GDK projects, you can set up [Visual Studio
2019](https://walbourn.github.io/visual-studio-2019/) (which can build
v141 and v142 platform toolset VC++ projects) or [Visual Studio
2022](https://walbourn.github.io/visual-studio-2022/) (which can build
v141, v142, and v143 platform toolset VC++ projects). You can also use
either a full Visual Studio install or the [Visual Studio Build
Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022).
Be sure to install the following components:

**Option 1: Full Visual Studio Install**

> The BWOIExample project uses the v142 toolset by default, which means it requires VS 2019 or VS 2022. Building with VS 2019 requires the MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest) component, and  VS 2022 requires the MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.29) component.                                                   |


# Setting up the build environment

Once the software requirements have been installed, you can set up an
extracted GDK that does not require installation. There are two ways to
do this. It's also possible to extract the Windows 10 SDK if desired.

***Note that the March 2022 GDK or later is required for VS 2022
support.***

## Method 1: Download the extracted GDK

This is recommended as the simplest option.

1.  Go to [Xbox Developer Downloads](https://aka.ms/gdkdl).

2.  Select "Game Core" as the file type.

3.  In the build/version menu, select "Microsoft GDK Extracted for Build
    Systems" for the GDK build you wish to use.

4.  Download the ZIP and extract it to a folder somewhere on your build
    machine. Choose a location with a short path to avoid MAX_PATH
    issues.

## Method 2: Install using the GDK NuGet package

This method makes use of the `Microsoft.GDK.PC.<edition>` package on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/).

1.  Download the [nuget.exe](https://www.nuget.org/downloads) and put in a path on your command-line

2.  Configurate a source for nuget.org per [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/configuring-nuget-behavior).

3.  Extract the GDK content using:

```
nuget install -ExcludeVersion -Source <name-of-source> Microsoft.GDK.PC.<edition> -OutputDirectory [path-for-extracted-sdks]
```

## Method 3: Extract the GDK manually

This method is more complex, but does not require a separate download.
You will need a copy of the standard GDK installer.

1.  **Open a Command Prompt** (this does not have to be a *Developer
    Command Prompt* for VS or the GDK).

2.  **cd** to the BWOIExample sample folder.

3.  Set up environment variables for VS 2022 or 2019 and provide your
    target edition number. If you specify a custom path for the
    extracted GDK, use a short, absolute, unquoted path to avoid issues
    such as exceeding MAX_PATH.

```
setenv vs2022 220300 [path-for-extracted-sdks]
```

4.  Extract the GDK from the installer image:

```
extractgdk <path-to-gdk-installer>\Installers
```

> All use of MSIEXEC takes a global lock, so even for just extract operations it will fail if another MSIEXEC instance is running at the same time (Windows update or other instance of the same script). For build pipelines run on the same VM, you need to provide some external lock/unlock cycle based on the use of the `Global\_MSIExecute` mutex and your own global lock. Generally, it's easier to just extract the MSI once on a developer's machine and copy the results to an agent-accessible folder.


## Optional: Extract the Windows 10 SDK

If you wish, you can also extract the Windows 10 SDK, which will ensure
the right version is always available on the build machine. This is
generally unnecessary, as long as you install the Windows 10 SDK (19041)
with your Visual Studio install.

This process requires a copy of the Windows 10 SDK installer image. The
easiest way to get this is to download the Windows 10 SDK .ISO
from [Windows Dev
Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk) (Version
10.0.19041.0 is required).

1.  **Open a Command Prompt** and **cd** to the BWOIExample folder.

2.  Set up the environment variables. Use the same path as your
    extracted GDK.

```
setenv vs2022 220300 [path-for-extracted-sdks]
```

3.  Extract the Windows 10 SDK from the installer image:

```
extractsdk <path-to-sdk-installer>\Installers
```

## VS 2019/2022 only: Merge VCTargets

In addition to setting up the flat file directory of the GDK, VS 2019
and 2022 BWOI rely on having a combined VCTargets folder that merges the
standard Microsoft.Cpp MSBuild rules with the GDK's MSBuild rules. For
VS 2019 and 2022 the robust solution is to create a merged folder
alongside the extracted GDK.

1.  **Open a Command Prompt** and **cd** to the BWOIExample folder.

2.  Set up the environment variables. Provide the path for your
    downloaded or manually extracted GDK.

```
setenv vs2022 220300 [path-for-extracted-sdks]
```

3.  Build the merged VC++ MSBuild targets directories and place them
    next to the extracted GDK:

```
vctargets
```

After running these steps, the ExtractedFolder environment variable
points to the extracted, portable GDK (and optional Windows SDK and
VCTargets directories) that the sample will build against. This folder
can be copied to any other build machine as well.

# Building the sample

The rest of the building is done as normal. This BWOI example is driven
by the Directory.Build.props file. The target vcxproj itself is
completely "stock" and if you remove the Directory.Build.props file will
work exactly as you'd expect on a normal developer system with the GDK
installed.

1.  **Open a Command Prompt** (this does not have to be a Developer
    Command Prompt for VS or the GDK).

2.  **cd** to the BWOIExample sample folder.

3.  Run **setenv** for VS 2022 or 2019 and your GDK edition target:

```
setenv vs2022 220300 [path-for-extracted-sdks]
```

> If you don't run setenv, the build will fall back to default values specified in Directory.Build.props. You can modify these directly in the file if you prefer. You will also need to make sure MSBuild is on the path if not using setenv.

4.  Build the project on the command-line:

```
msbuild BWOIExample.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=Gaming.Desktop.x64

msbuild BWOIExample.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=Gaming.Xbox.XboxOne.x64

msbuild BWOIExample.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=Gaming.Xbox.Scarlett.x64
```

> For VS 2019, if you only wish to support v142 platform toolset projects and did *not* install ``Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.v141.x86.x64``, then you should edit the Directory.Build.Props to remove the setting of ``VCTargetsPath15``. Similarly, for VS 2022, remove both ``VCTargetsPath15` and ``VCTargetsPath16`` if you only installed support for the v143 platform toolset.

# Building in a Windows container

As an alternative, Windows containers, run with Docker, can be used to
create an isolated, reproducible build environment. These can be used on
build servers, or even for local developer builds, to ensure a
consistent build process. This sample includes a Dockerfile that sets up
a BWOI build environment using the Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools.

> The process described here requires that the project use the v142 toolset or later. To learn more about Windows containers, see the [Containers on Windows documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/).

To use the Dockerfile, you still need to provide an extracted GDK, and
optionally an extracted Windows SDK. However, you don't need to install
Visual Studio on the host machine.

1.  Ensure Docker is installed and set to use Windows containers, as
    described
    [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment).

2.  Move the Dockerfile to a parent directory that contains both the
    BWOIExample project and the extracted SDKs, for example:

```
<parent dir>
-> Dockerfile
-> BWOIExample
-> <project and script files>
-> sdks
-> Microsoft GDK
-> <extracted GDK files>
-> <optional extracted Windows SDK>
```

> Docker only needs access to setenv.cmd, vctargets.cmd, and the extracted SDKs when building the container. You can place the actual project source elsewhere if you wish.


3.  Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run:

```
docker build -t gdkbwoi:latest -m 2GB --build-arg
ExtractedSDKDir="sdks" --build-arg ScriptDir="BWOIExample"
--build-arg GDKVer="220300" .
```

> To allow your container to use additional CPU cores, use the ``--cpus=N`` flag. To use additional memory, change the value in the ``-m 2GB`` flag.

Docker automates the process of creating the container, downloading and
installing the VS Build Tools, copying the necessary \*.cmd scripts and
extracted SDKs, and merging the VCTargets.

4.  Once the container is built, run it with:

**Using cmd.exe:**

```
docker run --rm -v %cd%\BWOIExample:c:\Project -w c:\Project gdkbwoi
msbuild BWOIExample.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=Gaming.Xbox.Scarlett.x64
```

**Using PowerShell:**

```
docker run \--rm -v \${pwd}\\BWOIExample:c:\\Project -w c:\\Project gdkbwoi
msbuild BWOIExample.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=Gaming.Xbox.Scarlett.x64
```

This command launches the container, mounts the project directory inside
it, and runs msbuild with the specified parameters. You can change the
configuration and platform as needed. To build a different project,
change "%cd%\\BWOIExample" to the project's location.

The container will exit when the build completes. Because the project
directory was mounted in the container, the build results will appear in
the project directory on the host machine.

# Additional Information

The Microsoft GDK documentation covers the MSBuild "BWOI" properties in
detail:

Microsoft Game Development Kit documentation
* Development and tools
  * **Using the Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) without installation.**

<https://aka.ms/GDK_BWOI>

The *CMakeExample* sample provides details on all the specific complier
& linker switches if using a non-MSBuild based build system. It supports
a build option (off by default) to enable using the same BWOI image
created by this sample's extractgdk.cmd script. The CMake example does
not need the results of vctargets.cmd because it doesn't use the
Gaming.\*.x64 MSBuild platforms.

See the **CMakeExample** for more details.

# Known Issues

With some versions of VS 2019, if using
DisableInstalledVCTargetsUse=true and the project contains
\<MinimumVisualStudioVersion\>16.0\</MinimumVisualStudioVersion\>, then
it can fail to build with:

> C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual
> Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(816,5):
> error : The BaseOutputPath/OutputPath property is not set for project
> \'X.vcxproj\'. Please check to make sure that you have specified a
> valid combination of Configuration and Platform for this project.
> Configuration=\'Debug\' Platform=\'Gaming.XBox.Scarlett.x64\'. You may
> be seeing this message because you are trying to build a project
> without a solution file, and have specified a non-default
> Configuration or Platform that doesn\'t exist for this project.

The workaround is to add an override to **Directory.Build.props**

```
<PropertyGroup>
<ExtractedFolder Condition="'$(ExtractedFolder)'==''">C:\xtracted\</ExtractedFolder>
<ExtractedFolder Condition="!HasTrailingSlash('$(ExtractedFolder)')">$(ExtractedFolder)\</ExtractedFolder>
<_AlternativeVCTargetsPath160>$(ExtractedFolder)VCTargets160\</_AlternativeVCTargetsPath160>
<_AlternativeVCTargetsPath150>$(ExtractedFolder)VCTargets150\</_AlternativeVCTargetsPath150>
<!-- Workaround for VS bug -->
<MinimumVisualStudioVersion>15.0</MinimumVisualStudioVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
```

This issue [was
fixed](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/1695-or-later-fails-when-using-disableinstalledvct/1435971)
in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.11.
