# CMake GDK Example

*This sample is compatible with the Microsoft Game Development Kit (March 2022)*

# Description

This is an example of using the [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
cross-platform build system to build an executable with the Microsoft
Game Development Kit via the Visual Studio generator.

![See the source image](./media/image1.png)

*This sample demonstrates how to use CMake to generate Gaming.\*.x64
platform VC++ project files that use the Microsoft GDK to build.* *For
an alternative method of utilizing CMake via the Ninja generator, see
**CMakeExample**.*

# Building the sample (Visual Studio)

Using Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 select "Open a local folder..." from
the New Project Dialog or the "File -\> Open -\> Folder..." menu command
and open the sample folder.

> This requires that you have the "C++ CMake tools for Windows" component (`Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.CMake.Project`) installed.

If needed, edit the **XdkEditionTarget** variable (either in the
CMakePresets.json or gxdk_toolchain.cmake / gxdk_xs_toolchain.cmake) to
ensure you have the correct GDK edition referenced.

The CMake tool should generate the cache automatically upon opening.
Otherwise select the CMakeList.txt and select "Generate Cache" from the
right-button menu. Then use the "Build -\> Rebuild All" menu command.

Choose which platform to build for in the combo box which will be
populated as follows using VS 2019 (16.11) or VS 2022 [CMake Preset
integration](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/cmake-presets-integration-in-visual-studio-and-visual-studio-code/):

See [Microsoft
Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio)
for more information on CMake in Visual Studio.

> If using Visual Studio 2022, edit CMakePresets.json to change this line from:

```
"generator": "Visual Studio 16 2019",
```

to:

```
"generator": "Visual Studio 17 2022",
```

# Building the sample (command-line)

You can also generate and build from the command line using a *VS x64
Native Developer Command Prompt*. For a complete list of available
presets, use:

```
cd CMakeGDKExample
cmake --list-presets
```

##

## Targeting Desktop

```
cmake --preset=x64-Desktop
cmake --build out\build\x64-Desktop
```

## Targeting Xbox Series X|S

```
cmake --preset=x64-Scarlett
cmake --build out\build\x64-Scarlett
```

## Targeting Xbox One

```
cmake --preset=x64-XboxOne
cmake --build out\build\x64-XboxOne
```

## Troubleshooting

*You may need to edit the CMakePresets.json to match your GDK edition.*

*For VS 2022, change the generator to "Visual Studio 17 2022".*

*Verify you are using CMake 3.20 or later with:*

```
cmake --version
```

# Using the sample (Visual Studio)

Open the generated SLN/VCXPROJ for your desired target from another
instance of Visual Studio:

```
CMakeGDKExample\out\build\x64-Desktop\CMakeGDKExample.sln
```

```
CMakeGDKExample\out\build\x64-Scarlett\CMakeGDKExample.sln
```

```
CMakeGDKExample\out\build\x64-XboxOne\CMakeGDKExample.sln
```

Then use F5 to deploy/run.

*If you press F5 from the original CMakeLists.txt context, then it will
fail to start because the loose layout is not placed inside the 'bin'
directory. For Gaming.Xbox.\*.x64 configurations, it also is attempting
to run on the development PC and not the remote console.*

# Using the sample (command-line)

To deploy the sample, open an *Xbox Gaming Command Prompt* instance and
change to the sample directory:

## Targeting Desktop

To run the 'loose' build, go to:

```
cd CMakeGDKExample\out\build\x64-Desktop\bin\Gaming.Desktop.x64\Debug
```

For Desktop packaging:

```
cd CMakeGDKExample\out\build\x64-Desktop
```

Edit ``bin\Gaming.Desktop.x64\Debug\MicrosoftGame.config`` to add the
``TargetDeviceFamily``.

```
<ExecutableList>
  <Executable Name="CMakeGDKExample.exe" TargetDeviceFamily="PC" Id="Game" />
</ExecutableList>
```

```
makepkg genmap /f chunks.xml /d bin\Gaming.Desktop.x64\Debug
makepkg pack /pc /f chunks.xml /lt /d bin\Gaming.Desktop.x64\Debug /pd .
```

## Targeting Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S

```
cd CMakeGDKExample\out\build\x64-Scarlett\Gaming.Xbox.Scarlett.x64
```

```
cd CMakeGDKExample\out\build\x64-XboxOne\Gaming.Xbox.XboxOne.x64
```

### Push deploy

To do push deploy the 'loose' layout:

```
xbapp deploy Layout\Image\Loose
```

### Run-from-PC

To run the 'loose' layout from the PC:

```
xbapp launch Layout\Image\Loose\CMakeGDKExample.exe
```

### Packaged deployment

Edit the ``Layout\Image\Loose\Microsoft.Config` to add a TargetDeviceFamily element:

```
<ExecutableList\>
  <Executable Name="CMakeGDKExample.exe" TargetDeviceFamily="Scarlett" Id="Game" />
</ExecutableList>
```

-or-

```
<ExecutableList>
  <Executable Name="CMakeGDKExample.exe" TargetDeviceFamily="XboxOne" Id="Game" />
</ExecutableList\>
```

To create a package:

```
makepkg genmap /f chunks.xml /d Layout\Image\Loose
makepkg pack /f chunks.xml /lt /d Layout\Image\Loose /pd .
```

Then install the resulting package to your console (the exact .xvc
filename may vary)

```
xbapp install CMakeGDKExample_1.0.0.0_neutral__8wekyb3d8bbwe_x.xvc
```

The sample when run creates a device and swapchain, and draws a colored
triangle. It has no controls or other behavior.

# Implementation Details

The **CMakeExample** uses the "Ninja" generator so does not make use of
the Microsoft GDK MSBuild rules. This version uses the "Visual Studio 16
2019 Win64" or "Visual Studio 17 2022 Win64" generator instead which
makes use of the Microsoft GDK MSBuild instructions.

The CMake generation makes use of a toolchain file passed as a
command-line:

| Platform | CMake Toolchain |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Gaming.Desktop.x64  |  `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="grdk_toolchain.cmake"` |
| Gaming.Xbox.XboxOne.x64 |  `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="gxdk_toolchain.cmake"` |
| Gaming.Xbox.Scarlett.x64 |  `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="gxdk_xs_toolchain.cmake"` |

All three of these also make use of a custom MSBuild property file
gdk_build.props.

The use of the Gaming.\*.x64 MSBuild rules with the GDK handles the
MicrosoftGame.Config localization, placing the CRT files into the
layout, etc.

CMake can't leverage the `FXCCompile` MSBuild target for shaders, so
CMakeLists.txt runs DXC as a custom target. The toolchain is responsible
for finding the correct version of the shader compile, which is why the
gxdk_toolchain.cmake and gxdk_xs_toolchain.cmake need the
**XdkTargetEdition** variable.

In order to support *Build Without Install* (BWOI) with the resulting
CMake, you need (a) to explicitly set **GDK_DXCTool** to point to the
proper DXC.EXE for the platform you are building, and (b) to make use of
the Directory.Build.props solution detailed in the **BWOIExample**
sample since the CMake-generated vcxproj uses the MSBuild rules for the
Microsoft GDK. The Directory.Build.props file needs to be present and
the environment properly setup when *generating* the CMake as well as
building the resulting SLN/VCXPROJ.

When generating from the command line using BWOI, you can specify
**GDK_DXCTool** by adding -DGDK_DXCTool=\<path\>, where \<path\> takes
the form ``<path to GDK>\<edition number>\GXDK\bin\<console>\dxc.exe``. For example:

```
-DGDK_DXCTool="d:\xtrctd.sdks\BWOIExample\Microsoft GDK\210600\GXDK\bin\XboxOne\dxc.exe".
```

## Side-by-side toolsets

Per the [Visual C++
blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/side-by-side-minor-version-msvc-toolsets-in-visual-studio-2019/),
you can use older versions of the compiler toolset with the newer
version of the Visual Studio IDE. In CMakeLists.txt, you can also
specify this via **set_property**.

```
set_property(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTYb VS_GLOBAL_ClearDevCommandPromptEnvVars "false")

set_property(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTY VS_GLOBAL_VCToolsVersion "14.20.27508")
```
