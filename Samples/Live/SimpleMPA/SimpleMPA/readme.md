# Description

This sample demonstrates how to use the Multiplayer Activity Service for
activities and invites.

# Building the sample

The sample should not require any specific changes to build and should
run without any modifications if using the XDKS.1 sandbox.

# Using the sample

When the sample is run you can create a multiplayer activity that has an
arbitrary string. Once an activity is created, you can update the
activity to show a different number of players in that activity.
Additionally, you can delete the activity or send invites to other
players for that activity. Finally, you can fetch the activities for
players on your friends list.
