# Building the sample

If using an Xbox One devkit, set the active solution platform to `Gaming.Xbox.XboxOne.x64`.

If using an Xbox Series X|S devkit, set the active solution platform to `Gaming.Xbox.Scarlett.x64`.

*For more information, see* __Running samples__, *in the GDK documentation.*

# Using the sample

The sample has no controls other than exiting.

# Implementation notes

The primary purpose of this sample is to familiarize the reader with the
ATG samples template structure, as well as provide a simple
demonstration of using Direct3D 12 APIs.

> **CreateDeviceDependentResources**: This is where the compiled vertex
> and pixel shaders blobs are loaded and the various Direct3D rendering
> resources are created. *The shaders are compiled by Visual Studio.*
>
> **Render:** This is where the triangle is rendered and presented to
> the screen.
