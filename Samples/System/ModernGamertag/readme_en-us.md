#   Modern Gamertag

*This sample is compatible with the Microsoft Game Development Kit
(March 2022)*

# Description

This code sample illustrates the process of creating and utilizing a
texture atlas to store Strings made up of 1 or more fonts, such as user
gamertags, for rendering on the screen. The implementation relies on
three primary classes to handle the bulk of the functionality.

1.  StringRenderer: Responsible for drawing strings to the screen. This
    class retrieves the strings from the texture atlas.

2.  StringTextureAtlas: Manages and caches the strings to a texture
    atlas.

3.  StringShaper: Responsible for rasterizing a string. It converts the
    string into a bitmap image so that it can be rendered and stored in
    the texture atlas.

This sample does NOT have an eviction policy; however it does support
the removal of Strings from the texture atlas. Implementation of an
eviction policy is left up to the reader.

# Building the sample
