#   Simple User Model Sample

*This sample is compatible with the June 2022 Microsoft Game Development
Kit (10.0.22000.4362)*

# Description

This sample shows how to use the new Simple User Model introduced with
the June Microsoft Game Development Kit.

# Building the sample

If using an Xbox One devkit, set the active solution platform to `Gaming.Xbox.XboxOne.x64`.

If using an Xbox Series X|S devkit, set the active solution platform to `Gaming.Xbox.Scarlett.x64`.

If using a PC, set the active solution platform to Gaming.Desktop.x64.

*For more information, see* __Running samples__, *in the GDK documentation.*

# Using the Sample

To launch the Simple User Model Sample on a devkit, you first need to
sign in a user and set the default devkit user. The default user can be
user using the *Xbox One Manager GDK* by checking "Auto Sign-In" for the
user. Alternatively, it can be set using the "xbconfig DefaultUser"
setting. Please see documentation on the Simple User Model for more
information.

The sample signs in the default user silently and shows their gamertag
and gamerpic on the screen. If the user changes their gamertag or
gamerpic, they will be updated on the screen as well. Press the \[View\]
button to exit the sample.

# Implementation Notes

The new simple user model greatly simplifies the user management code
needed by a title when the title intends to have a single default user.
Examples can include single-player games, single-user always-online
titles, RPGs, and more.

When looking at the sample code, search for the "\[Simple User Model\]"
comment to find locations related to using the simple user model.

To enable the simple user model for your title, you need to edit
MicrosoftGame.config and add the following entry:

```xml
<!-- Opt into requiring a default user at launch and to use the simple user model. -->
<AdvancedUserModel>false</AdvancedUserModel>
```

The default value is currently *true* for titles built with the June
2022 GDK release. This may change in a future GDK major release to
default to *false*. On titles built with GDK versions older than April
2021, this setting does not exist and the user model available is only
the advanced model.

When using the simple user model, user sign-in/sign-out behavior, user
events, PLM (Process Lifetime Management) events, and related
functionality change and can be handled in simpler ways than when using
the older advanced model. See the following table for information on the
changes and how the handling has been simplified:

| Feature  |  Handling with Simple User Model  |  Handling with Advanced User Model             |
|----------|---------------------------------|------------------------|
| Default User / Primary User  |  On console, the user who launches the title from the Xbox home screen is set as the immutable default user for that title's lifetime. On PC, if nobody is signed in, the game will get terminated and the PC Bootstrapper will get launched to help sign-in a user. Subsequent launches will work just fine so long as the user is fully signed into Xbox Live. |  The title must manually establish and manage the primary user for the title. See [XR-112](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/xbox/partner/xr112) for more information. |
| Sign-In & Sign-Outs  |  Signing in the default user with *XUserAddAsync* and the *AddDefaultUserSilently* flag is guaranteed to succeed silently. On console, if the default user becomes signed-out, the title is suspended. On PC, if the default user becomes signed-out, the title is terminated. Extra users beyond the default user are handled the same as with the advanced user model. |  No assumptions can be made about the success of a sign-in attempt. The title is not automatically suspended if any user is signed out. Instead, the title must handle sign-ins and sign-outs according to [XR-115](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/xbox/partner/xr115). |
| PLM  |  The application will terminate the title when attempting to start the title from the Xbox home screen with a different user than the one that previously launched it. On console, the application will relaunch automatically. On PC, the application must be relaunched manually. |  All PLM events should be handled accordingly, including any that cause change/loss of users and/or devices. |
| User Events  |  The default user never receives Sign-In/Out related user events. Extra users do receive the Sign-Out/In related events. All users receive other user change events, such as gamertag and gamerpic change events. |  All users can receive all user events. |

The behavior described in the table above is the behavior when testing
on PC or console (retail console or when using the Xbox home screen to
launch and test applications on a devkit).

When using a devkit with DevHome, testing PLM using testing tools, or
other devkit applications, there are some extra cases to consider.

-   You can get user sign-out/in related events for the default user if
    you signed out the default user, signed in a new user, and then
    manually resumed the title using the Xbox Manager application or
    other PLM testing tools. This case does not need to be handled for
    retail usages.

-   You need to set a default user for launching the title on a devkit
    when not using the Xbox home screen to launch. To do this, you can
    check "Auto Sign-In" in the Xbox Manager application or by using
    "xbconfig DefaultUser" settings.

sign-in/out events, gamepad pairing, XR handling, and other more
advanced user topics, please see the UserManagement Sample.
